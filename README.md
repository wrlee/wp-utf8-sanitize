This plugin is designed to handle the broken characters that might appear on your blog posts, if their content is converted from/to UTF8 and ISO-8859-1.

## Description ##

This plugin is designed to &#8220;_fight_&#8221; the broken UTF8 
characters on your WordPress powered site.

Install the **_UTF8 Sanitize WordPress plugin_** and you 
will be able to fight those ugly characters. Additionally, you can customize 
what actions you want to perform on them - either convert them to their original 
values once and for all by modifing your posts&#8217; database, OR leave all 
your posts intact and instead convert the ugly chars each time a post is loaded 
(all these options are controlled from the WordPress admin panel).

1. Upload the unarchived folder to your plugins directory (this is `wp-content/plugins/`)
1. Activate the plugin in your WordPress administration panel (this is the Plugins page)
1. Configure the plugin from the Options page in the WordPress administration panel
1. That’s it ;)
